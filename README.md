Title: OpenAI API Wrapper for Unreal Engine 5 - C++ Implementation

Description:
The OpenAI API wrapper you developed in C++ is a valuable tool that allows seamless integration of the OpenAI API into Unreal Engine 5 projects. This wrapper simplifies the process of leveraging OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities within Unreal Engine 5, enabling developers to create advanced and interactive experiences.

Key Features:
1. C++ Implementation: The API wrapper is implemented in C++, taking advantage of the performance and flexibility offered by the language. C++ is well-suited for developing high-performance applications and ensures optimal utilization of system resources within Unreal Engine 5.

2. OpenAI API Integration: The wrapper seamlessly integrates with the OpenAI API, enabling developers to tap into a wide range of language-related tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more. It provides an easy-to-use interface for making API requests and processing the API responses directly within Unreal Engine 5.

3. Simplified Workflow: The API wrapper simplifies the process of making API calls, handling authentication, and managing API keys or tokens required for communication with the OpenAI API. This abstraction allows developers to focus on the implementation of their Unreal Engine 5 projects without worrying about the low-level API details.

4. Error Handling and Resilience: The wrapper includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation even in challenging scenarios. It provides appropriate error messages or notifications in case of connectivity issues, API errors, or response parsing failures, allowing developers to handle exceptions and provide effective feedback to users.

5. Performance Optimization: The wrapper optimizes performance by efficiently managing API requests and responses within Unreal Engine 5. It minimizes unnecessary data transfers, ensures efficient memory management, and utilizes multithreading or asynchronous processing when applicable to improve overall performance and responsiveness.

6. Documentation and Usage Guidelines: The repository includes comprehensive documentation and usage guidelines, helping developers understand the API wrapper's integration process and utilize its functionalities effectively. The documentation covers installation instructions, code samples, and best practices, facilitating easy adoption and integration into Unreal Engine 5 projects.

By developing this C++ API wrapper, Unreal Engine 5 developers have a tool to seamlessly integrate the OpenAI API into their projects. This wrapper simplifies the process of utilizing advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling the creation of interactive and intelligent experiences. Whether it's for dialogue systems, character interactions, or text-driven gameplay mechanics, the API wrapper enhances Unreal Engine 5 projects with cutting-edge AI capabilities from OpenAI's API.
